            Hello! I'm a passionate developer with a love for creating elegant solutions in code. My journey into web development started with a simple "Hello World" and has grown into a full-fledged passion for building tools that are both useful and beautiful.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-neutral-300">
            When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the latest tech trends, contributing to open-source projects, or brewing the perfect cup of coffee.
